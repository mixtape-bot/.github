# Mixtape has been Shutdown

In case you haven't noticed, Mixtape has been offline for 2 months. This isn't due to any concerns with playing YouTube but instead a result of the primary
owner's Discord Account being compromised.

If you are still in our old Support Server please leave it and join our the [**Dimensional Fun**](https://discord.gg/8R4d8RydT4) server where you can get in contact with us and have a chance to try out our new Bot.

We hope you enjoyed the bot while it lasted!

## Warning

As mentioned, the Discord account that owns the verified Mixtape application is compromised. Do NOT interact with it and in case it interacts with you
ignore it and send screenshots in the aforementioned **Dimensional Fun** Discord Server.

Our domain also expires by the end of the month (**Oct. 31, 2022**).

You can kick it btw ;)

Mixtape is the perfect discord bot to play your favorite tunes.

## Organization

This is an organization for many of the internal libraries we use, open source or not.  
A few of these are meant for public use so they will get support, and others not so much.

- [**Dimensional Fun #mixtape**](https://discord.gg/rqH4Qdx7qv) A server mainly meant for everything [Dimensional Fun](https://www.dimensional.fun/) but is where Mixtape support is held.

## OSS Forks

We fork a lot of the libraries we use, so to minimize clutter we created a github organization just for our forks.
