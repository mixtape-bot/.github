Mixtape is the perfect discord bot to play your favorite tunes.

## Organization

This is an organization for many of the internal libraries we use, open source or not.  
A few of these are meant for public use so they will get support, and others not so much.

- [**Dimensional Fun #mixtape**](https://discord.gg/rqH4Qdx7qv) A server mainly meant for everything [Dimensional Fun](https://www.dimensional.fun/) but is where Mixtape support is held.

## OSS Forks

We fork a lot of the libraries we use, so to minimize clutter we created a github organization just for our forks.
