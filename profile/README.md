Mixtape is a discord music bot that plays high-quality music from YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and SoundCloud.

## Organization

This is an organization for many of the internal libraries we use, open source or not.  
A few of these are meant for public use so they will get support, and others not so much.

- [**Main Server:**](https://discord.gg/TUYc4nn
) The main (support) server for Mixtape
- [**Development Server:**](https://discord.gg/Vkbmb8kuH4) A server mainly meant for development related things (where you'd get support for our projects).

## OSS Forks

We fork a lot of the libraries we use, so to minimize clutter we created a github organization just for our forks.
